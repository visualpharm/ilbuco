      <h2>About Cariló</h2>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>Cariló is a charming coastal town located in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Known for its extensive pine forests and beautiful beaches, it offers a unique blend of natural beauty and modern amenities. The name "Cariló" comes from the indigenous Mapuche language, meaning "green dune," which perfectly describes the area's distinctive landscape.</p>
        <p>The town was designed as a resort community with strict building codes that preserve the natural environment. Streets wind through the forest, and homes are built to complement rather than dominate the landscape.</p>

      <h2>Il Buco's Setting</h2>
      <p>Our property is nestled in the pine forest, just a short 100-meter walk from the beach. This prime location offers guests the best of both worlds: the tranquility of the forest and the proximity to the ocean.</p>
      <p>The building was designed in 2025 by a foreign architect using suspended concrete volumes and high-performance walls, creating a modern retreat that harmonizes with its natural surroundings.</p>
